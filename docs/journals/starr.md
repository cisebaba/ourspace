        We as a group set up an additional layer of security on git by setting up additional branches on git.

        I worked with Amanda and Cise to set up conference/events but we ran into a lot of issues trying to set up the APIs.

        Finding an api that is formatted the way we want and is currently being maintained proved difficult. We also ran into issues when considering how we wanted to store this information in our database. We ultimately decided it might be best to allow people to manually put in the data as a string and then call an external api on the frontend to Query match in order to eventually filter events. This will allow us to move forward and potentially work around some of the data integration issues when using a third party api.

    <ul>
        <li>
        I realized the benefits to having your data stored on the backend and not stored in the frontend/browser. By utilizing the backend you increase security and also reduce the load your webpage has on a users computer.

        We worked together today to decided on a website name of OurSpace, finish setting up docker, made a django project/application for events and set up our frontend application using react.

        Some challenges from today was setting up the docker files and making sure our react application was using the volume we wanted. We ultimately figured it out and was overall a great learning experience.
        </li> 
    </ul>
<li> Ah-Ha Moment : </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
        A potential roadblock I see for us is when we add more microservices/django apps to handle other features and getting those all set up in docker correctly.

        Our Team spent most of today working together to make some final decisions on the application architecture and implementing changes based on the feedback we received from Chris and Curtis.

        Some highlights of discussion were the importance of utilizing a ubiquitous language. Deciding that we are going to try to use both MongoDB and a Relational database. We are leaning more towards trying to use react to build the bulk of the application. We also identified some potential roadblocks surrounding the implementation of some of our features such as Upvoting and execution of the mentorship page.
        </li> 
    </ul>
<li> Ah-Ha Moment : </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
        I was surprised to learn that some of our more conceptually simple features might end up being the hardest to implement for example, the Upvote feature and Search feature. I am excited to see how we end up tackling those blocks.
