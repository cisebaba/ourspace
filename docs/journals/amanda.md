Today I worked on: 

* Revising overall file tree, deciding the final App name and making changes accordingly in the GitLab project settings, and started building the Events microservice with the dev team.

As a group, we voted on the list of App names we had brainstormed and we landed on: OurSpace. We also came to a consensus on using the Events microservice on our starting point and getting the Django project and app set up for building that out. We worked on the docker-compose YAML file and created and successfully ran our Docker image. We discussed our next steps and organizing our group into pairs (one 2-person and one 3-person pair, to start). Last, we updated our GitLab project name and settings based on our final app name. 

It was a big win to get the Docker containers orchestrated correctly. I learned more today about the process for creating a React app from scratch and how to hook it into Docker.

Today I worked on: 

* Reviewing and implementing project feedback with the dev team.

As a group, we discussed and documented the overall system architecture of our app. 
We revised several of our data models and API endpoints. 
We also began building the initial skeleton of our application and started building out
the docker compose YAML file. 

I realized today that seemingly simple concepts like "upvotes" can be a lot more
complex under the hood! I am glad we fleshed out our thinking around some of these
things, and really focused on agreeing upon a ubiquitous language for our problem
domain before going straight into writing code. I think this will benefit us as a team
as we move forward.
