Today we configured our app's docker-compose.yml file, requirements and dockerfile and got our project hooked up to docker successfully. We decided to use Django for the events microservice. We also have an official name!

Curtis helped me understand to not just copy the example code we have been given and to be really intentional with the needs of our project.

My ah-ha is that a lot of this is more flexible than I realize. There are several ways to do things, and certain things like changing file structures down the rode are not as big of a deal as they might seem.

Today our full team spent our project time applying feedback from Curtis and Chris to our data-model and apis. We established a stronger common language and vision.

We worked out the details of the Upvote model, as well as detailing foreign key relationships in our data-model.md more clearly. We decided to use both MongoDB and PostgreSQL. We discussed using FastAPI and React vs. Django.

I'm really happy we took the time to carefully consider the design and models. My ah-ha today was when Chris mentioned we might consider using both MongoDB and relational databases. I knew it was possible, but I didn't realize it might be optimal for a project of our scope- and I'm excited to use both.
