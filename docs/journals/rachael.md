Today our full team spent our project time applying feedback from Curtis and Chris to our data-model and apis. We established a stronger common language and vision.

We worked out the details of the Upvote model, as well as detailing foreign key relationships in our data-model.md more clearly. We decided to use both MongoDB and PostgreSQL. We discussed using FastAPI and React vs. Django.

I'm really happy we took the time to carefully consider the design and models. My ah-ha today was when Chris mentioned we might consider using both MongoDB and relational databases. I knew it was possible, but I didn't realize it might be optimal for a project of our scope- and I'm excited to use both.

## note for next time-

apply Chris's first name/ last name/ honoriffic suggest.
