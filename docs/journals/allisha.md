We used a random generator to make teams and distribute the tasks for today. worked on dividing up tasks for the day, with one group ( Rachael and I ) working on the events microservice and one group (Starr, Cise, and Amanda) working on the jobs microservice. I added to our google docs sheet a couple of things that we need to implement into our project at some point, such as continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI / CD) and creating unit tests. We had some issues with GitLab and got help from instructors to set up branches in GitLab and merging.

2. done - create jobs microservice 
3. write poller? - find way to FASTAPI way not django/poller

Today, we worked together to decide on the name OurSpace for our application! We worked together on building and setting up the docker yaml file. We created a django project and app for our events microservice. We created our react app for the front-end of our application. We moved some files around such as moving the journals directory to the docs directory for better tree structure and to make our files cleaner. We updated our project name and path url on GitLab. It was a bit confusing and took a lot more effort to build the yaml file and get docker setup than I thought it would, but we eventually got it to work!

Today, I worked on:

* Worked together on revising our docs files

Worked together on the software architecture of our app. Fixed our apis and data models based on the feedback we received. We started working on the initial skeleton of the docker yaml file.

I realized that the "upvotes" feature, although seemingly simple, requires much more complex thoughts and processes.
