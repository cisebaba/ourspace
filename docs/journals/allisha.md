Today, we worked together to decide on the name OurSpace for our application! We worked together on building and setting up the docker yaml file. We created a django project and app for our events microservice. We created our react app for the front-end of our application. We moved some files around such as moving the journals directory to the docs directory for better tree structure and to make our files cleaner. It was a bit confusing and took a lot more effort to build the yaml file and get docker setup than I thought it would, but we eventually got it to work!
