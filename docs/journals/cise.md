 We used group generator and I stayed at the same microservice with Starr and Allisha. We worked on a json file how to load the data of states and cities implement with with django. We got help from Mitch and figured how to load the json data to database. We made the Location & Events api CRUD done.

 We divided to groups after figuring git issues about our branches. I was with Amanda and Starr working on events microservice. We spend most of our time on how should the Location Entity get the data from. It was a long research and discussion. We created our models I've jumped into the views to finish at least events part. 
 After stepped away I had my AHA! moment about npm installing us states suggestion which came from Starr. We were thinking about how could we attach it with the api and out Location entity. While spending so much time on the same think, I can't expand my perspective but finally got the logic in the way of thinking backwards. As we handled the forms it is gonna create a state and the state will mount it with api and post will handle adding into database. Looking forward to try it tomorrow!

 I created a file structure tree for team to help to visualize the project as like the other given repos on the weekend. It helps me to visualize and create a starter point and I was sure it will help to my team too. I did some quick research on the weekend to find a starter point of a project. It's been a long time since we haven't start our projects on our own and find out if we want to use django get back into the module 1 commands(it was good to refresh my memory) Find out some helpful link about react app installation but ended up trivia-game-testable readme file super helpful. 
 Our team spend our time find the best name for our project. After voting session, we decided to start first microservice on Django so started project. First microservice Docker dev file, docker compose file and the last react app is created. We got help and had super productive meeting with Curtis. We ended our day with changing name on our gitlab repo.

 While I was doing the changes on my branch we did meeting and I shared my screen. We discuss about unmatched fields and put thing in the order. Decided to create id for voting and attach it with the user. 
 We spend our meeting mostly on the architecture and road mapping. We started on docker file but couldn't be successful on it yet.
