Today I worked on: 

* Reviewing and implementing project feedback with the dev team.

As a group, we discussed and documented the overall system architecture of our app. 
We revised several of our data models and API endpoints. 
We also began building the initial skeleton of our application and started building out
the docker compose YAML file. 

I realized today that seemingly simple concepts like "upvotes" can be a lot more
complex under the hood! I am glad we fleshed out our thinking around some of these
things, and really focused on agreeing upon a ubiquitous language for our problem
domain before going straight into writing code. I think this will benefit us as a team
as we move forward.
